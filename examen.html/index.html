        <h3>Cancion michael jackson letra billie Jean</h3>
        <p>She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
            I said: Don't mind, but what do you mean: I am the one
            Who will dance on the floor in the round?
            She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round
            
            She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
            Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
            Who will dance on the floor in the round
            
            People always told me: Be careful of what you do
            And don't go around breaking young girl's hearts
            My mother always told me: Be careful of who you love
            And be careful of what you do, 'cause the lie becomes the truth
            
            The Billie Jean is not my lover
            She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
            But the kid is not my son
            She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
            
            For forty days and for forty nights
            The law was on her side
            But who can stand when she's in demand
            Her schemes and plans
            'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
            So take my strong advice
            Just remember to always think twice
            (Do think twice, do think twice)
            
            She told: My baby, we danced 'til three
            Then she looked at me
            Then showed a photo: My baby cried
            His eyes were like mine
            'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
            
            People always told me: Be careful of what you do
            And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
            But she came and stood right by me
            Just to smell her sweet perfume
            This happened much too soon
            She called me to her room
            
            The Billie Jean is not my lover
            She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
            But the kid is not my son</p>
